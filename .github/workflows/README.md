# CI with github-actions:
[![Build all platforms](https://github.com/BrunoBerger/AOTVR/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BrunoBerger/AOTVR/actions/workflows/build.yml)  
For more information go to
https://game.ci/docs/github/getting-started

### Setup :
Only needed once
1. Run `activation.yml` to request an activation-file from unity
2. Download and un-zip the artifact generated by this the action
3. Go to https://license.unity3d.com/manual and upload the artifact-file
4. Download, extract and open the license-file
5. On GitHub, got to Settings > Secrets and create a new secret
named `UNITY_LICENSE` and past the content of the license-file as the value

#

### Building:
6. Run the `Build all platforms`/`build.yml`  workflow, which will generate the finished builds as artifacts

- make sure you include the scenes you want in the build-settings in Unity
- For now the action has to be triggered manually,
but it can also be triggered on events in the repo or weekly/monthly
(more info in build.yml or [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions))
- The game can also be build for different platform at the same time,
simply uncomment the one you need in `build.yml`
